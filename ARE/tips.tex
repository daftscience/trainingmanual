\section{Getting Assay Information}

Additional information for each assay can be found by \boldcap{Right-clicking} on the \textsc{Result Cell} and selecting the appropriate option from the menu.\\

\subsection{Calculation Equations}
To view the equation used in calculated values:\sidenote{This will not work for calculations that are performed by rules \eg{Teg Platelet mapping.}}

\paragraph{Select} \boldcap{Show Equation\ldots}

\newthought{A Pop-up window} will appear with the equation and a list of the equation's components.\\

\subsection{Procedure Information\label{subsection:are_show_proc_info}}

To view the various ranges, delta calculations, units of measure and more:

\paragraph{Select} \boldcap{Procedure Information\ldots}\\

\importantblock{Since many of the ranges can changes based on \boldcap{sex} and \boldcap{age}, the information displayed is specific to the current patient. The ranges may not apply to other patients.}

\section{Previous Results}
The most recent previous results will appear to right of the result.\\

\marginnote[-4\baselineskip]{Notice that the \textsc{Time} column has two different values. This means that the previous results are mostly likely separate orders.}

\subsection{Multiple Previous}

\newthought{To view all} the previous results for an assay:

\paragraph{Right Click} on the result cell.

\paragraph{Click} \boldcap{Previous Results}\ldots\\

\prettyimage{width=.4\textwidth}{graphics/prev_menu}

\newthought{This will open} the \textsc{Previous Results} window for that assay.\\
