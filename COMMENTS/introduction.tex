\glspl{comment} and \glspl{note} can be added to Orders, Results, and Collections. They are used to provide additional\sidenote{\eg{Collection Instructions.}} information or instructions and to document events\sidenote{\eg{Documenting critical calls.}}.

Comments can be added by Providers to give the laboratory additional information, or they can be added by the laboratory to give Providers additional information.

Notes are internal to the laboratory. They cannot be seen by providers.

\section{Comments vs. Notes}
When entering \textsc{Comments}, you have the option to enter it as a \textsc{Comment} or as a \textsc{Note}. The main difference between the two is that \textsc{Notes} are internal to the laboratory.

\begin{description}
    \bolditem{\glspl{comment}} Additional information that can be viewed by anyone with access to the order or result.

\importantblock{Result Comments are part of the result. After a result has been verified, the \textbf{Result Comment} can not be modified without ``Correcting'' the result\sidenote{\checkref{ch:correction_mode}{\refptchapp{part:are}{ch:correction_mode}{are}}{Refer to the \gls{are} procedure for more information.}}.}
    \bolditem{\glspl{note}} Additional information for the laboratory only. Note cannot be seen by the floors.

\gls{are} will differentiate \textsc{Comments} and \textsc{Notes} between an order and a specific result.\\
