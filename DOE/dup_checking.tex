\noindent
Cerner will check for, and correct, duplicate orders at three points before the sample gets to the laboratory. At each point, it will look for different types of duplication.

\begin{quote}
    \warning{After the \gls{accn} has been assigned, Cerner will not be able to perform the more complicated duplicate checking. The following rules work in most normal situations; however, it does not apply to \textbf{Add-Ons} or orders placed incorrectly.}
\end{quote}

\section{When Orders Are Placed}
When orders are ``Submitted,'' Cerner will look back to ensure that we are not creating duplicate orders.\sidenote{The amount of time it will look back depends on the test it is checking.}

If a previous order exists for one you've placed in the \gls{spad} it will need to be removed before continuing.\sidenote{This is checking for duplicates at the \textsc{orderable} level \eg{if two Basic Panels were ordered.}}

\section{When Orders Are Dispatched}
Cerner will check for duplicates within the orders\sidenote{This is checking for duplicates at the \textsc{Assay} level \eg{If an Electrolytes Panel (or even just a Potassium) was ordered with a Basic Panel.}} on the \gls{spad}. Any duplicates will be canceled immediately after being ordered.

Similar checking also occurs for scheduled orders placed by the floors. It happens before the \gls{accn} is assigned and the order is \textit{Dispatched}.

\section{When Orders Are Logged-In}
There are cases where two orderables have partial duplications. The Renal Function Panel is the best example of this.

Most of the assays in a Renal Function Panel are also in a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Phosphorous being the one exception.

In these situations, when the sample is \textsc{Logged-in}, Cerner will cancel the Renal Function Panel and order a Phosphorous.\\

\section{Example}

Here is an example of duplicate checking which demonstrates the last two situations.\\

An order was placed for a \boldcap{CMPNL, RENPNL,} and \boldcap{LYTES}\\

\newthought{When the order} was \textit{Dispatched},\sidenote{at 22:37} the Electrolytes Panel was canceled. Again, this happened because the Electrolytes is included in a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel.

\newthought{When the sample} was \textit{Logged-in}\sidenote{at 22:38} the Renal Function Panel was canceled and the Phosphorus was added-on.

\newthought{The end result,} a \boldcap{Comprehensive Metabolic Panel} and \boldcap{Phosphorus}, contains all the original assays without any duplication.
