Samples sent from other facilities need to be \textsc{Logged-in} to the testing laboratory before they can be resulted.

Log-in by List is used to \textsc{Log-In} all of the samples contained on a \textsc{Collection} or \textsc{Transfer List}. This section discusses that process. However, there is a better way to \textsc{Log-in} entire lists at the end of this section.

\infoblock{The recommended way to Log-In lists is by using \boldcap{Log-in By Accession}, then use \boldcap{Log-in By List} to confirm that all the samples have arrived. \refpt{sec:login_workflow} for more information.\sidenote{This will save a considerable amount of time, while also providing a quick and accurate way of verifying that all the samples have arrived.}}

\section{List Pop-Up Alerts}
\textsc{Log-in By List} has two Pop-Up boxes it will display.

\newthought{List Not Found} will be displayed if it cannot find a list with that number, for that date.\\

\prettyimage{width=.5\textwidth}{graphics/list_not_found}

\newthought{What If the List Exists?} There are three things that can cause this Pop-Up:
\begin{description}
    \bolditem{Wrong Type} The \textsc{List Number} was entered into the wrong field.\sidenote{\eg{A Transfer List Number was entered into the Collections List field.}}
    \bolditem{Wrong Date} The \textsc{Date Field} does not have the correct date.
    \bolditem{Wrong Number} The \textsc{List Number} was not entered correctly.
\end{description}


\newthought{No Orders Found} will be displayed if all of the containers for a list have been \textsc{Logged-In}.\\

\prettyimage{width=.5\textwidth}{graphics/no_orders_found.png}

\newthought{This means} all the samples have been \textsc{Logged-in}. The list is now ``Empty.''

\section{Recommended Procedure}\label{sec:login_workflow}
This method eliminates the need to manually compare the \textsc{Transfer List} with the containers received.

It will save a considerable amount of time, and as long as the barcode scanners are used, it will identify any missing samples.

\paragraph{Log-in} each container using \boldcap{Log-in By Accession}.

\paragraph{Attempt} to \textsc{Log-in} the \textsc{List} using \boldcap{Log-in By List}.

\newthought{If there are no missing} samples, \textsc{Log-in By List} will display an alert.\\

\prettyimage{width=.5\textwidth}{graphics/no_orders_found.png}

\warnblock{This alert looks dangerously close to the \boldcap{List Not Found} alert.}

\newthought{If samples are missing,} the \textsc{Log-In By Transfer List} window will open and the missing containers will populate the Spreadsheet.\\

\prettyimage{width=\textwidth}{graphics/login_list_containers}

These samples may have been missed during the initial \textsc{Log-in} process, or they may still be at their site of origin. Either way, it's time for some detective work.
