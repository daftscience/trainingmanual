Here are some \gls{login} tips. Knowing these functions can save time, and simplify your work-flow.

\section{Modifying a Single Container}\label{sec:mod_single}
If only one value needs to be modified, it can be done by clicking on its cell in the \textsc{\gls{login} Spreadsheet}.\marginnote[\baselineskip]{The downside to this method is the collection information needs to be updated for each orderable. This can be time consuming.}\\

\noindent
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{scope}
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] (image) at (0,0) {\prettyimage{width=\linewidth}{graphics/mod_one} };
    \begin{scope}[x={(image.south east)},y={(image.north west)}]
        \draw [-stealth, line width=3pt, deeppurple400] (0.2, 1.05) to[out=270, in=180] (0.67,0.5);
    \end{scope}
\end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}%



\section{Refreshing Data}\label{sec:refresh_data}

After the samples have been \textsc{Logged-in}, they will remain in the \textsc{\gls{login} Spreadsheet}. While they don't need to be removed before continuing with other samples, it is a good idea to periodically clear them out.

\paragraph{Click} the \textsc{Refresh Data}\sidenote{The glasses and cup.} \btn{graphics/refresh_data} icon from the toolbar.\\

\noindent
\prettyimage{width=\textwidth}{graphics/toolbar.png}

\importantblock{This will only remove samples which have been \textbf{Logged-in}.\sidenote{Their Check-boxes will be disabled.} Unfortunately, you can't remove samples that have not been \textbf{Logged-in} or \textbf{Missed}\sidenote{Sorry.} without closing the window and re-opening it.}


\section{Printing Labels}
Before samples have been \textsc{Logged-in}, the labels can be quickly reprinted.
\paragraph{Hit} {\faKeyboardO} \boldcap{Ctrl+B}

\section{Keyboard Shortcuts}

% Here is a list of \acrlong{doe} hotkeys:\\
