There are two ways to build \textsc{Transfer Lists}: \textsc{List Build} and \textsc{Manual Build}.

    \bolditem{List Build} This allows you to choose from the containers which need to be sent.
    \bolditem{Manual Build} This allows you to build a list by scanning the containers.\sidenote{This method is the best way to make sure the list is accurate.}
