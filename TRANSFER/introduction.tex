When testing is performed at another facility, it needs to be \textsc{Transfered} in Cerner before it's picked up by the currier.

This process tells Cerner that the sample is one its way from the one location to the next. It will update the sample status in \gls{ci} and help with specimen tracking.

\newthought{Transfer lists} can be thought of as a log of samples going from one location to another.
