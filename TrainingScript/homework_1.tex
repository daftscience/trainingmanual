\chapter{Troubleshooting Exercises}

    These exercises will simulate common issues you may run into while working with Cerner. If you have difficulty, refer to the the troubleshooting sections of the Training Guide.

    And remember, \textsc{Container Inquiry} will be your best friend.

    \section{Exercise One}

        \warnblock{\textsc{Please do not modify this accession number.}}

        \activity{Search for 15-344-000050 in Container Inquiry}

        \answer{Why Can't this be resulted?}

        \answermulti{What needs to be done to correct this?}

    \section{Exercise Two}

        George is trying to result this Serum hCG, but he is having trouble.

        \answer{Why can't George enter a result?}

    \section{Exercise Three}

        Elaine is trying find the orders on an Accession Number, but \textsc{Order Result Viewer} will only let her enter a Medical Record Number.

        \bigskip
        \prettyimage{width=\textwidth}{graphics/orv}

        \answermulti{Why can't Elaine enter an Accession Number?}

        \answer{How does she fix it?}



\chapter{Accession Result Entry}

\importantblock{If you do not normally result within Cerner you can skip this section.}

    For the next few questions, use the Accession Number you created earlier.

    \section{Chemistry Resulting}

    \activity{Result the \textsc{Comp Panel}.}

    \activity{Open the \boldcap{Procedure Information} for the Sodium.}\sideref{part:are}{subsection:are_show_proc_info}

    \answer{What is the Reference Range}



    \section{CBC Resulting}

    \importantblock{This section covers topics not discussed in the class. It may be especially challenging.}

    \activity{Enter results for the \textsc{CBC}.}\sideref{part:are}{sec:man_res_entry}

    \infoblock{Select ``Manual Differential'' for the \boldcap{Differential?} result.\sideref{part:are}{are:cbc_manual_reflex}}

    \activity{Verify the results.}

    \answer{What happened?}\marginnote{\hint{Take a look at Order Result Viewer.}}

    \activity{Result the \textsc{Differential and Morphology}.}\sideref{part:are}{subsect:are_performing_manual_diff}
