\section{I can't find my printer!}

\begin{itemize}
    \bolditem{Check your filters} Right click on the list of printers and set the \textsc{Filter Type} to \textsc{Printers}.
    \bolditem{Make sure it exists} If the printer is new, it may need to be built into Cerner. Contact Information Systems.
\end{itemize}


\section{I'm Missing Accessions}

There are a few things that can cause this:

\begin{itemize}
    \bolditem{Accession isn't Logged in} Only \textsc{In-Lab} orders will appear. Simply log it in.
    \bolditem{Accession is already on a list} If the Accession was placed on another worklist, it may not show up when trying to create new worklists.
    \bolditem{You removed it} If you've removed it, you can simply add it back again.
\end{itemize}
